Sentiment Analysis On Gojek App Reviews Using SVM and IndoBERT

📱 Sentiment Analysis on Gojek App Reviews
This project performs sentiment analysis on user reviews of the Gojek app, one of Southeast Asia’s leading super apps. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we analyze user feedback to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

🚀 Objectives
Scrape or collect reviews from the Gojek app (e.g., from Google Play Store).

Preprocess and clean textual data (e.g., remove stopwords, tokenization, normalization).

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand common themes and sentiment distribution.

Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).

Visualize sentiment trends and keyword insights.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, NLTK, Sastrawi

Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

(Optional) Google Play Scraper or custom review dataset

📊 Model Performance
Includes evaluation using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix
